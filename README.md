# Unity Collider Optimizer

Optimizes Mesh & Polygon colliders in Unity.

| Original Sprite | Unity Polygon Collider | Optimized Polygon Collider |
|**Path Count**| *213 paths* | *23 paths* |

The tool uses a [C# implementation](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/18936/A-C-Implementation-of-Douglas-Peucker-Line-Appro) of the Ramer Douglas Peucker Algorithm to smooth the polylines and reduce the number of paths created by a Polygon Collider in Unity.

You can run this test on your machine by cloning the project and going to the `Polygon Collider Optimization Test` scene in Unity.

#### Usage
* Download the `collideroptimizationpackage_2d_v003.unitypackage` package from the [Releases](https://github.com/aniketrajnish/Unity-Collider-Optimizer/releases/).
* Import all the assets from the package in your unity project.
* Attach the `PolygonColliderOptimizer.cs` scrpit on your 2D sprite.
* Adjust the `optimizationFactor` to control the amount of optimzation you need.

|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Original Mesh | Unity Mesh Collider | Optimized Mesh Collider |
|**Triangles Count**| *9132 tris* | *2416 tris* |

The tool uses the [Computational Geometry Unity Library](https://github.com/Habrador/Computational-geometry) by Erik Nordeus üêê to perfrom the Quadric Error Metric simplification on the shared mesh of the mesh collider.

You can run this test on your machine by cloning the project and going to the `Mesh Collider Optimization Test` scene in Unity.

#### Usage
* Download the `collideroptimizationpackage_3d_v003.unitypackage` package from the [Releases](https://github.com/aniketrajnish/Unity-Collider-Optimizer/releases/).
* Import all the assets from the package in your unity project.
* Attach the `MeshColliderOptimizer.cs` scrpit on your 2D sprite.
* Choose the connecting mode between _Fast, Precise, and No._
* Adjust the `optimizationFactor` to control the amount of optimzation you need.
* Choose the mesh style to be _Soft, Hard or both_.
* **Warning: Choosing the "Fast" mode would likely lead to errors, Precise mode is recommended for most of the meshes.**

## Contribution
Contributions to the project are welcome. Currently working on conevrting the QEM algorithm to a couroutine to stop the main Unity thread from freezing.

## Known Bugs
If a prefab is made out of a gameobject having Polygon Collider Optimizer, it keeps refreshing itself.
